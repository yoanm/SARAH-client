# [S.A.R.A.H.](http://sarah.encausse.net)

[S.A.R.A.H.](http://sarah.encausse.net) is an OpenSource client/server framework to control Internet of Things using Voice, Gesture, Face, QRCode recognition. It is heavily bound to Kinect v1 and v2 SDK.


This project contains C# **Client for SARAH**. And will communicate with [NodeJS Server for SARAH](https://github.com/yoanm/SARAH-Server-NodeJS).

## Description

SARAH v4.0 Client is built on an **AddOns Architecture** sharing common properties. Each AddOn:

- communicate with each other using AddOnManager
- MUST implements IAddOn or AbstractAddOn
- MUST be declared in properties and can be prevent from starting with `{name}.enable` property
- Use Tasks to work with stream asynchronously and tune CPU usage.

Client's Addons are stored in *AddOns* folder and have **no relation with SARAH plugins**. The idea is to sandbox features and library into subprojects. 


This page describe Client's Core/AddOns specification. SARAH developers should see :
- [SARAH Wiki](http://wiki.sarah.encausse.net)
- [SARAH RFE and Issues](http://issues.sarah.encausse.net)


## AddOns: Blob

UNDER CONSTRUCTION

This AddOn use EmguCV to Detect and Draw blobs in camera frame according to color, shape, features, ...


## AddOns: Body Engine

SARAH provides NBody: an abstract representation of Body / Skeleton implemented by Kinect 1, Kinect 2, and other computer vision tools.

This AddOn draw body parts, joints and relevant areas.

- HTTP & XML `
- ` parameter to start/stop recognition

## AddOns: Debug

This AddOn implements logging features to output relevant data about SARAH:

- All logs in a log file
- Audio (wav) of matching commands
- Audio (wav) of SARAH voice speech

### Properties

```
; Path to log file
log-file=AddOns/debug/${shortdate}.log

; Path to recognized command
dump=AddOns/debug/dump/${date}.wav

; Path to audio response
voice=AddOns/debug/voice/${date}.wav"
```

## AddOns: Face Recognition

This AddOn use EmguCV to perform Face Detection and Face Recognition. In a Nutshell:
 
- Provide a GUI to train new faces
- Draw detected faces' rectangle
- Update NBody data with face rectangle
- Update NBody data with face name
- Forward recognition to ProfileManagers
- Store datas in AddOn's directory
- HTTP & XML `face` parameter to start/stop recognition 

### Properties

Choose face detection and recognition algorithms. See also [CodeProject article](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/261550/EMGU-Multiple-Face-Recognition-using-PCA-and-Paral).

```
; Cascade for Face detection
HaarCascade=AddOns/face/haarcascades/haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml

; Algorithm confidence
Eigen_Threshold=0
Fisher_Threshold=0
LBP_Threshold=30
```

## AddOns: Google Speech

This AddOn use GoogleSpeech API to perform Speech2Text on speech recognitions.

- Process grammar with *dictation* attribute
- Process rejected dynamic grammar

Since 2014 Google narrow it API v2 to 50 req/day ! **An API Key MUST be provided** to the plugin (See G+ tutorial and explanations).

## AddOns: HTTP Engine

This plugin handle HTTP communication with SARAH Server. It provides to other AddOns the ability to send GET/POST/FILE request with a custom token.

- Send request for SpeechRecognition
- Send requestion for MotionDetection
- All request are filled with contextual data (ClientId, Profile, ...)
- BODY response is forwarded with the token to other AddOns 


### Properties

```
[http.remote]

; Remote address of NodeJS server
server=http://127.0.0.1:8080

[http.local]

; Local HTTP server port
port=8888

temp=AddOns/http/temp/
```

### FIXME
- Start HTTP Server on 8888

## AddOns: IP Camera

UNDER CONSTRUCTION

This AddOn use EmguCV or nVLC to process frames of IP Camera 
- but EmguCV hangs forever...
- but nVLC Crash ...


## AddOns: Kinect v1

This AddOn use Kinect SDK v1.8  to start all connected Kinects v1 XBox360 or Windows.

- Start a SpeechEngine with Kinect audio stream with a given confidence
- Start a color stream of 1280 x 960 at 12 fps
- Start a skeleton stream for other AddOns
- Detect motion using depth stream 
- Provides sub plugin framework

The motion detection stops as much as possible stream when there is no motion. Properties allow control of streams: Audio stream only or custom fps.

### FIXME

- Handle Gesture

## AddOns: Kinect v2

This AddOn use Kinect SDK v2.0  to start one connected Kinects v2 for Windows.

- Start a SpeechEngine with Kinect audio stream with a given confidence
- Start a color stream of 1920 x 1080 at 15/30 fps
- Start a skeleton stream for other AddOns
- Detect motion using depth stream 
- Provides sub plugin framework

The motion detection stops as much as possible stream when there is no motion. Properties allow audio stream only.

### Gesture

Add support to Kinect 2 GestureManager using machine learning algorithm 


## AddOns: Gesturemanager

This AddOn is a wrapper for all Gesture recognition performed by low level AddOns (kinect)

## AddOns: FaceRecognition

This AddOn performs Facial detection and recognition then add face to Client/Server contexte data


## AddOns: Microphone

This AddOn use Microphone to start a SpeechEngine with given confidence.

### Properties

```
; Confidence of recognition (from 0 to 1)
confidence=0.7

; Define the audio device index (0 is the default device, see logs)
device=0
```

### FIXME

- Handle multiple device number

## AddOns: OS Manager

OS Manager allow HotKeys that could be triggered anywhere on Windows (without focus). 
Keys are sentto servers side plugin to perform rules
 
OS Manager allow GamePad that could be triggered anywhere on Windows (without focus). 
Buttons are sent to servers side plugin to perform rules


## AddOns: Pitch Tracker

This AddOn use the speech audio stream to compute voice pitch and update ProfileManagers. 

## AddOns: Profile Engine

This AddOn manage profile for people playing with SARAH.

- A profile is cross device

- Handle engagement with SARAH

### FIXME

- Handle people engagement
- Add profile timeout on properties
- Store profile to disk

## AddOns: Speech Engine

This AddOn build a Speech Engine for each provided audio stream (Kinect, Microphone, ...).
 
- Grammar Manager maintains a cache of XML of plugins
- Grammar can be in multiple languages 
- SARAH name is hot replaced according to properties
- Context Manager run/stop grammars accortding to context
- Context Manager handle dynamic grammar
- The `bot.name` must match an improved confidence
- `bot.name` is optional with user is engaged
- Good match trigger engagement until a given timeout

## Getting started
### Download
```bash
> git clone https://github.com/yoanm/SARAH-client.git
```
 
### Tweak 
 * Edit [custom.ini](./custom.ini) file and set what you need. By default S.A.R.A.H will enable only microphone and will be launched in debug mode.
 
### Launch
 - Run [Start_Client.cmd](./Start_Client.cmd)
 - To check if client is running go to http://127.0.0.1:8888/?tts=Ok. S.A.R.A.H should tell you "Ok".
 - In [debug mode](./custom.ini#L31), client will log helpful information in [AddOns/debug](./AddOns/debug)/YYYY-mm-dd.log

### What's next
If not already done, install and start [S.A.R.A.H server](https://github.com/yoanm/SARAH-Server-NodeJS) !
